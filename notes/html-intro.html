      <p>
        This “tutorial” is hacky and incomplete. Please give corrections,
        suggestions in the comments.

      <h3 id="lets-talk-about-the-web">Let’s talk about the web</h3>
      <p>
        The web was created by Tim Bernes-Lee while working at CERN, the
        research institute in Geneva Switzerland. He wanted a way to lnk the
        many files on his collegues computers together. This action of linking
        pages together is called “Hypertext” and the language used to describe
        these pages is called <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. The web is a
        collection of webpages.
      </p>
      <h3 id="lets-talk-about-browsers">Let’s talk about Browsers</h3>
      <p>
        Broswers are software used to view and explore webpages. You write HTML
        to describe to your browser what your web page should look like, what it
        should do and other details about your page. HTML files are saved with
        the <code>.html</code> extension.
      </p>
      <h3 id="html-syntax">HTML Syntax</h3>
      <p>
        The Syntax of a language are the rules guide the forming of statements
        in that language. In pidgin for example you don’t say
        <code>dey I</code> when someone asks how you are. Instead you respond
        with <code>I dey</code>. Same way HTML has rules that define how the
        language is written. Every HTML code is made up of elements, these are
        the building blocks of your webpage. You add elements to a page and can
        add embed elements also. Elements are represented by tags:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;element name&gt; content &lt;/element name&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        An opening and closing tag with content in the middle. If you want to
        add a paragraph element, you put a paragraph tag like so:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;content&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        When the browser sees this tag, it will display a paragraph element with
        that text. You don’t have to memorize these tags, it’s how you use them
        that matter.
      </p>
      <h4 id="html-element-attributes">HTML Element Attributes</h4>
      <p>
        Most HTML elements have attributes you can use to change something about
        that element. You add attributes to the first opening tag of the
        element. Let’s say there was an element called “Student” (there is none
        btw). Without attributes our student element is a generic fellow. But
        when we add some attributes they get interesting!
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;student&gt; I am a student &lt;/student&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Meh, Generic Student element</p>
      <pre><code> &lt;student name=”Emmanuel” level=”Senior” hotel=”Trivago”&gt; I am a student &lt;/student&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Whoa! This is an interesting fellow!</p>
      <h3 id="html-webpage-structure">HTML Webpage structure</h3>
      <p>
        Not all HTML elements/tags are for displaying something. Some provide
        information about the page and provide structure for other elements or
        the entire page.<br />
        This is the basic structure of a web page in HTML. You can see the
        <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag? That’s the element telling the browser
        that this is a HTML page. Then the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags
        provide more data about our page and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag
        is where all our visual elements go.
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt; Nothing here will be displayed in the browser &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt; Everything here will be displayed in the browser &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <h3 id="lets-make-our-first-web-page">Let’s make our first web page</h3>
      <p>
        To make a webpage we need to create a HTML file, for that we need a text
        editor. One common one that comes with all Windows computers is Notepad.
        On Mac, that will be TextEdit. Open your text editor and write out a
        basci webpage using the structure I outlined above. Then add some
        elements, like a Header tag
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. You can find more about
        HTML elements on
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp">W3Schools</a>.
        Generally, W3Schhols is a great resource for learning HTML, CSS and
        Javascript. Bookmark it ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember to place your visual elements (paragraphs, headers) inside the
        <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. And don’t forget to close
        all your tags. When you are done, save your TXT file as a .html (or
        .htm) file and open it with your browser. You should see your page!
